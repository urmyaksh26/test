Interest Rates: More Than Just a Number
The book says interest rates can be seen in a few ways:

Required Rate of Return: Imagine you're lending money to someone. You'd want not just your money back, but a little extra for letting them use it and for the risk you're taking, right? That "little extra" is like a required rate of return. Investors need this to be willing to lend their money or invest.
Discount Rate: If someone promises to give you $100 a year from now, that $100 isn't worth the same as $100 in your hand today. Why? Because you could use that $100 today to earn interest. So, we use an interest rate (as a discount rate) to figure out what that future $100 is worth today. It’s like "discounting" the future value back to the present.
Opportunity Cost: Let's say you have $100. You can either spend it now on a nice dinner or save it in a bank account that pays 5% interest. If you choose the dinner, you're giving up the opportunity to earn that 5% interest. So, that 5% is the opportunity cost of spending the money now instead of saving it.
Why are interest rates different for different things?

It's because of risk and inflation. The book explains that an interest rate is basically built up from a base rate plus some "premiums" for different kinds of risks:


Real Risk-Free Rate: This is a theoretical rate. Imagine a super safe, short-term loan where there's absolutely no chance the borrower won't pay you back, AND there's no inflation to worry about. This rate basically just compensates you for waiting to use your money (this is called "time preference" – people generally prefer to have things now rather than later).

Inflation Premium: We know prices generally go up over time (inflation). If you lend money, you want the interest to cover this rise in prices so your money doesn't lose its buying power. So, we add an inflation premium to the real risk-free rate. 
The Nominal Risk-Free Rate is approximately the Real Risk-Free Rate + Expected Inflation Rate. Think of U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills) – they are considered very safe (risk-free of not being paid back), but the rate they offer includes an expectation of inflation.

Other Risk Premiums: On top of inflation, there are other risks: 

Default Risk: What if the borrower doesn't pay you back? That's default risk. The higher this risk, the higher the premium (extra interest) you'd demand.
Liquidity Risk: How easily can you sell your investment and get your cash back without losing value? If it's hard to sell quickly, it has high liquidity risk, and you'd want a premium for that.
Maturity Risk: For bonds, longer-term bonds usually have more risk that their prices will change if interest rates in the market change. So, longer-maturity bonds often have a maturity risk premium.

So, a typical interest rate you see (like on a company bond) would be:
Nominal Rate of Interest = Real Risk-Free Rate + Inflation Premium + Default Risk Premium + Liquidity Premium + Maturity Premium 

This part basically tells us that interest rates are not arbitrary; they reflect the cost of time, the expectation of inflation, and compensation for various risks.
