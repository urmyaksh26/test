MODULE 1.1:Interest Rates: More Than Just a Number
The book says interest rates can be seen in a few ways:

Required Rate of Return: Imagine you're lending money to someone. You'd want not just your money back, but a little extra for letting them use it and for the risk you're taking, right? That "little extra" is like a required rate of return. Investors need this to be willing to lend their money or invest.
Discount Rate: If someone promises to give you $100 a year from now, that $100 isn't worth the same as $100 in your hand today. Why? Because you could use that $100 today to earn interest. So, we use an interest rate (as a discount rate) to figure out what that future $100 is worth today. It’s like "discounting" the future value back to the present.
Opportunity Cost: Let's say you have $100. You can either spend it now on a nice dinner or save it in a bank account that pays 5% interest. If you choose the dinner, you're giving up the opportunity to earn that 5% interest. So, that 5% is the opportunity cost of spending the money now instead of saving it.
Why are interest rates different for different things?

It's because of risk and inflation. The book explains that an interest rate is basically built up from a base rate plus some "premiums" for different kinds of risks:


Real Risk-Free Rate: This is a theoretical rate. Imagine a super safe, short-term loan where there's absolutely no chance the borrower won't pay you back, AND there's no inflation to worry about. This rate basically just compensates you for waiting to use your money (this is called "time preference" – people generally prefer to have things now rather than later).

Inflation Premium: We know prices generally go up over time (inflation). If you lend money, you want the interest to cover this rise in prices so your money doesn't lose its buying power. So, we add an inflation premium to the real risk-free rate. 
The Nominal Risk-Free Rate is approximately the Real Risk-Free Rate + Expected Inflation Rate. Think of U.S. Treasury bills (T-bills) – they are considered very safe (risk-free of not being paid back), but the rate they offer includes an expectation of inflation.

Other Risk Premiums: On top of inflation, there are other risks: 

Default Risk: What if the borrower doesn't pay you back? That's default risk. The higher this risk, the higher the premium (extra interest) you'd demand.
Liquidity Risk: How easily can you sell your investment and get your cash back without losing value? If it's hard to sell quickly, it has high liquidity risk, and you'd want a premium for that.
Maturity Risk: For bonds, longer-term bonds usually have more risk that their prices will change if interest rates in the market change. So, longer-maturity bonds often have a maturity risk premium.

So, a typical interest rate you see (like on a company bond) would be:
Nominal Rate of Interest = Real Risk-Free Rate + Inflation Premium + Default Risk Premium + Liquidity Premium + Maturity Premium 

This part basically tells us that interest rates are not arbitrary; they reflect the cost of time, the expectation of inflation, and compensation for various risks.

MODULE 1.2: TIME-WEIGHTED AND MONEY-WEIGHTED RETURNS.

This module is all about figuring out how well an investment portfolio has performed, but it looks at performance in two different ways, especially when money is being added to or taken out of the portfolio.

Money-Weighted Rate of Return (MWRR)
Imagine you have an investment account. You put money in, maybe you add more later, and perhaps you take some out. The Money-Weighted Rate of Return (MWRR) calculates the actual return you earned on your specific invested money, considering when you put money in and when you took it out.

It's basically the Internal Rate of Return (IRR) for your portfolio's cash flows.
Think of it like this: The MWRR is the interest rate that makes the present value of all the money you put in (including the starting amount) equal to the present value of all the money you took out (including the ending amount and any withdrawals).
The timing and size of these cash flows heavily influence this rate.
Let's elaborate on the book's example:

Scenario:

Time 0 (Start of Year 1): You buy 1 share of stock for $100. (This is like an outflow from your pocket, or an inflow into the investment account).
End of Year 1: The stock paid you a $2 dividend (on the 1 share you own). You then buy another share for $120.
So, at the end of Year 1, you effectively had a cash inflow of $2 (dividend) and then an outflow of $120 (new share purchase).
The net cash flow for you at this point is: $2 (dividend) - $120 (cost of new share) = -$118. Or, from the account's perspective, it received $118 from you (plus it generated $2 from the stock).
End of Year 2: You now own 2 shares. Each share paid a $2 dividend. So, you receive $2/share * 2 shares = $4 in dividends. You then sell both shares for $130 each, so you get 2 * $130 = $260 from the sale.
Total cash inflow to you at the end of Year 2 is $4 (dividends) + $260 (sale proceeds) = $264.
Calculating MWRR:
To find the MWRR, we're looking for a rate (let's call it 'r') such that:
$100 (initial investment) + $118 (net investment at end of year 1) / (1+r) = $264 (what you got back at end of year 2) / (1+r)^2
(This is a slightly simplified way to think about the cash flows from the investor's perspective, focusing on net contributions and withdrawals. The book sets it up for a calculator using the account's cash flows: initial value as inflow, deposits as inflows, withdrawals as outflows, and ending value as an outflow if you were to close the account.)

The book shows the cash flows from the account's perspective:

CF0 (Time 0): +$100 (You deposited $100)
CF1 (End of Year 1): Dividend was $2. You bought another share for $120. So, your net deposit was $120 - $2 = $118. So, +$118.
CF2 (End of Year 2): Dividends were $4 (2 shares * $2). You sold both shares for $260 (2 shares * $130). Total value taken out is $260 + $4 = $264. So, -$264 (money leaving the account).
Using a financial calculator, the MWRR is 13.86%.

What this 13.86% means: It means that your specific investment decisions (buying that second share at $120) and the timing of those cash flows resulted in an overall return of 13.86% per year on the money you had in the account. If you had put in more money right before the stock did really well, your MWRR would be higher. If you put in more money right before it did poorly, your MWRR would be lower.

Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR)
The Time-Weighted Rate of Return (TWRR) aims to measure the performance of the investment itself, removing the effects of when you added or withdrew money. It tells you how much $1 would have grown if left in the investment over the entire period, regardless of your personal deposit/withdrawal activity.


This is the method preferred by the investment industry to judge how well a portfolio manager is doing, because the manager often doesn't control when clients put money in or take it out.

Here’s how it’s calculated, using the same example:

Step 1: Break the period into subperiods based on when significant cash flows occur.

Subperiod 1 (Year 1): From Time 0 to End of Year 1 (just before you buy the second share).
Subperiod 2 (Year 2): From End of Year 1 (just after you buy the second share) to End of Year 2.
Step 2: Calculate the Holding Period Return (HPR) for each subperiod.

Subperiod 1 (Year 1):

Beginning value: $100 (1 share)
Dividend received during Year 1: $2 (on that 1 share)
Value just before the next cash flow (i.e., before you buy the second share at $120 at the end of Year 1): The share price is now $120.
HPR1 = (Ending Value + Cash Flow Received - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value HPR1 = ($120 + $2 - $100) / $100 = $22 / $100 = 0.22 or 22%
Subperiod 2 (Year 2):

Beginning value (after you bought the second share): You now have 2 shares. The first was worth $120, and you bought the second for $120. So, total value is $120 (share 1) + $120 (share 2) = $240.
Dividends received during Year 2: $2/share * 2 shares = $4.
Ending value (you sold both for $130 each): 2 * $130 = $260.
HPR2 = (Ending Value + Cash Flow Received - Beginning Value) / Beginning Value HPR2 = ($260 + $4 - $240) / $240 = $24 / $240 = 0.10 or 10%
Step 3: Compound the returns to get the TWRR.

TWRR = [(1 + HPR1) * (1 + HPR2) * ... * (1 + HPRn)] - 1
TWRR = [(1 + 0.22) * (1 + 0.10)] - 1 TWRR = [1.22 * 1.10] - 1 TWRR = [1.342] - 1 TWRR = 0.342 or 34.2% (This is the total return over 2 years)
To get the annual TWRR, we find the geometric mean:

Annual TWRR = (1.342)^(1/2) - 1 Annual TWRR = 1.1584 - 1 = 0.1584 or 15.84% 
Comparing MWRR and TWRR
Notice the difference:

MWRR = 13.86%
TWRR = 15.84%
Why are they different? 
The MWRR (13.86%) is lower than the TWRR (15.84%).
Let's look at the subperiod returns:

Year 1 return (HPR1) was 22% (good performance).
Year 2 return (HPR2) was 10% (not as good).
In the MWRR calculation, the second year's lower performance (10%) received a greater weight because there was more money in the account during Year 2 ($240 at the start of Year 2 vs. $100 at the start of Year 1). You bought that extra share right before a period of relatively lower return.

If you contribute a lot of money just before a period of poor performance, your MWRR will be lower than your TWRR.
If you contribute a lot of money just before a period of good performance, your MWRR will be higher than your TWRR.
When to use which:

TWRR: Use this when you want to evaluate the skill of the investment manager or the inherent performance of the investment strategy itself, without the influence of when money was added or removed. This is the industry standard for comparing managers.
MWRR: This tells an investor what their actual personal rate of return was, given their specific timing of investments and withdrawals. It's more relevant if the manager does have control over the timing of cash flows into and out of the portfolio.
Essentially, TWRR measures the performance of the investment, while MWRR measures the performance of the investor's money given their cash flow decisions.

================================================================================================================================================================================================

MODULE 1.3: COMMON MEASURES OF RETURN.

This module focuses on standard ways to express and adjust investment returns so they can be easily understood, compared, and used in different calculations.

Annualized Returns
Often, you might earn a return over a period that isn't exactly one year (e.g., 90 days, or 500 days). To compare these returns with others, or to use them in annual financial planning, we convert them into an annualized return. This tells you what the return would have been if it had continued at the same rate for a full year. 

How to calculate it:
The basic idea is to figure out your return for the period you held the investment (this is your Holding Period Return, HPR) and then scale it up or down to a 365-day year.

The formula given is: Annualized Return = (1 + HPR)^(365/days) - 1 
Where 'days' is the number of days you held the investment.

Example 1: Shorter than one year 

You deposit $100.
After 90 days, your account balance is $100.75.
Calculate your HPR for the 90 days:
HPR = (Ending Value / Beginning Value) - 1
HPR = ($100.75 / $100) - 1 = 1.0075 - 1 = 0.0075 (or 0.75%)

Annualize it:
Annualized Return = (1 + 0.0075)^(365/90) - 1
Annualized Return = (1.0075)^4.0555 - 1
Annualized Return = 1.03056 - 1 = 0.03056 or 3.056%

So, earning 0.75% over 90 days is equivalent to earning about 3.056% over a full year, assuming the same rate of return.

Example 2: Longer than one year 

An investor buys a 500-day government bill for $970.
At maturity (after 500 days), they redeem it for $1,000. 
Calculate your HPR for the 500 days:
HPR = ($1,000 / $970) - 1
HPR = 1.0309278 - 1 = 0.0309278 (or about 3.09%)

Annualize it:
Annualized Return = (1 + 0.0309278)^(365/500) - 1
Annualized Return = (1.0309278)^0.73 - 1
Annualized Return = 1.02249 - 1 = 0.02249 or 2.249% 

In this case, because the holding period was longer than a year, the annualized return is lower than the HPR for the 500-day period. You're essentially spreading that 3.09% gain over a shorter, 365-day equivalent period.

The Effect of Compounding Frequency (A Quick Refresher)
The book briefly touches on how the frequency of compounding (how often interest is calculated and added to the principal) affects values. 

More frequent compounding leads to a higher Future Value (FV): If you invest $100 at 10% annual interest, you get $110 after a year. If it's compounded semi-annually (5% every 6 months), you get $100 * (1.05) = $105 after 6 months, and then $105 * (1.05) = $110.25 after the year. That extra $0.25 is because you earned interest on the first period's interest.
More frequent compounding leads to a lower Present Value (PV): If you need $100 in a year, you'd have to invest less today if the interest is compounded more frequently.
The book shows how the PV of $1,000 to be received in one year at a 6% stated annual rate decreases as compounding frequency increases (from semi-annual to daily).  This is because the "effective" annual rate becomes slightly higher with more frequent compounding.

Continuously Compounded Returns
This takes the idea of compounding frequency to its extreme. What if you compounded interest every second? Every millisecond? The mathematical limit of this is continuous compounding. 

Why use it?
Continuously compounded returns have a neat mathematical property: they are additive over time.  If you have a continuously compounded return for Period 1 and another for Period 2, you can just add them together to get the continuously compounded return for the combined period (Period 1 + Period 2). This isn't true for simple percentage returns that are not continuously compounded. This property is very useful in financial modeling, especially for derivatives.

How to calculate it:
Given a simple Holding Period Return (HPR), the continuously compounded return (often denoted Rcc) is:
Rcc = ln(1 + HPR)
where 'ln' is the natural logarithm. 

You can also calculate it from the price relative (Ending Price / Beginning Price):
Rcc = ln(Ending Price / Beginning Price) 

Example: 

Stock purchased for $100.
Sold one year later for $120. 
Simple HPR: ($120 / $100) - 1 = 0.20 or 20%.

Continuously Compounded Return:
Rcc = ln(1 + 0.20) = ln(1.20) = 0.18232 or 18.232% 

Notice the continuously compounded return (18.232%) is slightly less than the simple HPR (20%). This is typical. To get a 20% return at the end of the year with continuous compounding, you'd start with a slightly lower continuously compounded rate.

Other Major Return Measures
These are mostly definitions to distinguish how returns are reported:

Gross Return vs. Net Return: 

Gross Return: Total return before deducting fees for management and administration of the investment account.  It does account for trading commissions and costs directly needed to make the investments. 

Net Return: The return after management and administration fees have been deducted.  This is what the investor actually gets.
Elaborated Example: Imagine a mutual fund reports a 10% return. If this is before they took out their 1% management fee, then 10% is the gross return. Your net return, what your account actually grew by from the fund's management perspective, would be 10% - 1% = 9%.

Pretax Nominal Return vs. After-tax Nominal Return: 


Pretax Nominal Return: Your return before any taxes are paid on it (e.g., on dividends or capital gains). 
After-tax Nominal Return: Your return after taxes have been taken out.  This shows the actual increase in your wealth that you can spend or reinvest.
Elaborated Example: If your investment earned a nominal return of 8% (pretax nominal return), and your tax rate on this investment income is 25%, then the tax amount is 25% of 8% = 2%. Your after-tax nominal return is 8% - 2% = 6%.

Real Return: 
This return is adjusted for inflation. It tells you how much your purchasing power has actually increased. 


Approximate Real Return = Nominal Return - Inflation Rate 
Exact Real Return = [(1 + Nominal Return) / (1 + Inflation Rate)] - 1 
Elaborated Example:

You earn a nominal return of 7%.
Inflation during the year is 2%.
Approximate Real Return = 7% - 2% = 5%. 
Exact Real Return = [(1 + 0.07) / (1 + 0.02)] - 1 = [1.07 / 1.02] - 1 = 1.04902 - 1 = 0.04902 or 4.902%.  Your investments grew by 7%, but since prices of goods and services went up by 2%, your actual ability to buy more stuff only increased by about 4.9%.
Leveraged Return: 
This refers to the return you get when you use borrowed money (leverage) to make an investment. The return is calculated on your own cash invested, not the total value of the investment.  Leverage can magnify both gains and losses.


Elaborated Example (from the concept, not a direct numerical one in this section of the book):
Suppose you have $1,000 of your own money.

Scenario A (No Leverage): You invest your $1,000 in a stock, and it goes up by 10%. You make $100. Your return on your cash invested is $100 / $1,000 = 10%.
Scenario B (With Leverage): You invest your $1,000 and borrow an additional $1,000 (let's say at 5% interest for the period). You invest the total $2,000 in the same stock, and it goes up by 10%.
Your total investment of $2,000 is now worth $2,200 (a $200 gain).
You have to pay back the $1,000 loan plus $50 interest ($1,000 * 5%). So, $1,050.
Your profit is $2,200 (investment value) - $1,050 (loan repayment) - $1,000 (your initial cash) = $150.
Your leveraged return on your $1,000 cash is $150 / $1,000 = 15%. Your return is higher than the 10% the stock made because of leverage. (The book provides a formula: Leveraged Rate of Return = r + [VB/V0 * (r - rB)] where r is the return on the total investment, VB is the amount borrowed, V0 is your equity, and rB is the borrowing rate. )
These common measures help standardize how returns are discussed and ensure everyone is on the same page about what a particular return figure represents


==============================================================================================================================================

MODULE 2.1: DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW (DCF) VALUATION

What Is “Discounted Cash Flow” (DCF)?
“Money you will get in the future is worth less than money you have today.”

This is because of opportunity cost—you could use or invest today’s money to grow more.

DCF helps you calculate:
"How much is ₹100 that I’ll get in 3 years worth today?"

The Formula:
If you expect to receive ₹100 in 1 year, and interest rate is 10%:

💡 Present Value (PV) = ₹100 ÷ (1 + 10%) = ₹100 ÷ 1.10 = ₹90.91
This means:

₹100 in 1 year is worth ₹90.91 today
(if you could earn 10% interest elsewhere)

DCF for Different Investments:
1. Zero-Coupon Bond
No interest payments

Only pays one big amount at maturity

🧾 Example:
If you’ll get ₹1,000 after 3 years, and rate = 6%:

PV = ₹1,000 ÷ (1 + 6%)³ = ₹839.62
So, you’ll pay ₹839.62 today to get ₹1,000 after 3 years.

2. Coupon Bond
(This pays interest every year)

Suppose it gives ₹100 per year for 3 years

Plus ₹1,000 at the end (final payment)

You discount each payment separately:

Year 1: ₹100 ÷ (1 + r)^1

Year 2: ₹100 ÷ (1 + r)^2

Year 3: ₹1,100 ÷ (1 + r)^3
(Add them all = total value today)

3. Preferred Stock (fixed dividend forever)
Like a bond but no maturity — just regular payments

🧾 Example:

Pays ₹8 every year, forever

Market wants a 10% return

PV = ₹8 ÷ 10% = ₹80
So, this stock is worth ₹80 today.

4. Common Stock (dividends may grow)
If dividend grows every year, use this:

PV = Dividend next year ÷ (Return % − Growth %)

🧾 Example:

Next year’s dividend = ₹2

Expected return = 12%, Growth = 4%

PV = ₹2 ÷ (12% − 4%) = ₹2 ÷ 0.08 = ₹25

5. Loan Payments (Annuity)
If you borrow ₹2,000 and repay over 5 years with equal payments and 6% interest:

Use the calculator or formula to find payment = ₹473.86
Each payment includes part interest + part principal.

🧠 Key Takeaway
DCF helps you figure out how much future cash is worth today.

Whether it’s a bond, stock, or loan — if money is coming (or going) in the future, DCF tells you how much to pay or expect today.

=======================================================================================================================================

MODULE 2.2: IMPLIED RETURNS AND CASH FLOW ADDITIVITY
This module focuses on two things:

How to calculate the return (interest rate) an investment is giving you — even if it’s not directly stated.

Why we can simply “add” future cash flows to get the total value — this is called the cash flow additivity principle.

Implied Return – What Return Am I Getting?
💡 What does "implied" mean?
It means the return isn’t given to you directly, but you can calculate it from the price and cash flows.

🧾 Example: Zero-Coupon Bond
You buy a bond for ₹650 today.
It pays you ₹1,000 after 5 years.

You want to know: “What return am I getting?”

Cash Flow Additivity Principle
💡 Simple Definition:
“The value of a bunch of future cash flows = the sum of the value of each cash flow.”

🧾 Why is this useful?
Because you can break big cash flows into smaller parts, and add them back up. It still gives the same value.

🧾 Example:
You’re promised:

₹100 in 1 year

₹200 in 2 years

₹300 in 3 years

Discount rate = 10%

You calculate the present value (PV) of each:

₹100 ÷ (1.10)^1 = ₹90.91

₹200 ÷ (1.10)^2 = ₹165.29

₹300 ÷ (1.10)^3 = ₹225.39

Add all the PVs:

Total PV = ₹481.59

This is the value today of all those future cash flows.

🔁 Why is this powerful?
It’s the basis for:

Bond pricing

Loan valuation

Stock valuation

Option pricing

Forward contracts

All these use the same idea: Break cash flows → Discount them → Add them

✅ Real-World Uses of Additivity
1. Forward Interest Rates
If you know today's interest rates for 1 year and 2 years, you can use them to find the interest rate for Year 2 only.

2. Currency Forward Rates
If you know interest rates in India and the US, and today’s USD/INR rate, you can calculate the future USD/INR rate — to avoid arbitrage (risk-free profit).

3. Option Pricing (Binomial Models)
Even complex things like stock options use this — break possible outcomes into pieces, discount them, and add.

=========================================================================================================================================

MODULE 3.1: CENTRAL TENDENCY AND DISPERSION
This topic is about how to describe and understand data, especially returns on investments. It teaches you how to summarize numbers using:

Central Tendency → Where the center of data is (average)

Dispersion → How spread out the data is (risk/volatility)

✅ PART 1: Central Tendency
💡 What is it?
It tells you the “typical” value of a dataset — basically, the average return.

🔢 1. Mean (Average)
Add all the values and divide by how many there are.

🧾 Example:
Returns = 5%, 7%, 9%

Mean = (5 + 7 + 9) ÷ 3 = 7%

🔢 2. Median
The middle value when numbers are arranged in order.

🧾 Example:
Returns = 3%, 5%, 8% → Median = 5%

🧾 Example 2 (even numbers):
Returns = 2%, 4%, 6%, 8%
Median = average of middle two = (4 + 6)/2 = 5%

🔢 3. Mode
The number that appears most often.

🧾 Example:
Returns = 4%, 6%, 6%, 7% → Mode = 6%

🤓 When do we use each?
Measure	Use When…
Mean	You want the general average
Median	Data has extreme values or outliers
Mode	You want the most frequent value

✅ PART 2: Dispersion
💡 What is it?
It tells you how spread out or volatile the numbers are. This is important in finance because more dispersion = more risk.

🔢 1. Range
Highest value − Lowest value

🧾 Example:
Returns = 3%, 6%, 9% → Range = 9 − 3 = 6%

🔢 2. Variance (σ²)
Tells you how much each number differs from the mean, on average.

🧾 Steps:

Find the mean

Subtract mean from each value

Square those results

Find the average of those squared differences

🔢 3. Standard Deviation (σ)
It’s just the square root of the variance.

It tells you how far typical values are from the average — and is widely used to measure risk in finance.

🧾 Example:

Mean return = 10%

Standard deviation = 2%
Most returns fall within 8% to 12%.

🔢 4. Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)
Average of absolute differences from the mean (without squaring)

Used less often in finance but gives a simpler view of variability.

🔢 5. Chebyshev’s Inequality (don’t memorize, understand conceptually)
It says: No matter the shape of data, most values lie within a few standard deviations from the mean.

Distance from Mean	At least this % of values lie within it
1 SD (σ)	At least 0% (nothing guaranteed)
2 SD	At least 75%
3 SD	At least 88.9%

✅ Final Concepts
🔢 Coefficient of Variation (CV)
This compares risk (standard deviation) to return (mean).
Helps choose investments with better risk-adjusted returns.

🧾 Formula:
CV = Standard Deviation ÷ Mean

Lower CV = Better (less risk per unit of return)

🧠 Summary Table
Concept	What it tells you
Mean	Average return
Median	Middle return
Mode	Most common return
Range	Simple spread (max - min)
Variance	Average squared difference from mean
Standard Deviation	Risk or volatility (spread from mean)
CV (Coefficient of Var)	Risk per unit of return

========================================================================================================================================

MODULE 3.2: Skewness, Kurtosis, and Correlation
This module adds more detail to how investment returns behave by looking at:

Skewness → Are returns symmetrical or lopsided?

Kurtosis → Are returns tightly clustered or do they have extreme outcomes?

Correlation → Do two investments move together or not?

✅ 1. Skewness – Is the Distribution Lopsided?
📌 What is it?
Skewness tells us whether data is balanced around the average or not.

📉 Types of Skew:
Type of Skew	Shape	What It Means
Symmetric (Skew = 0)	Bell-shaped	Equal chance of big gains/losses
Positive Skew	Long tail to the right	More small losses, fewer big gains
Negative Skew	Long tail to the left	More small gains, fewer big losses

🧾 Example:

Stock with rare huge gains = positive skew

Investment with rare crashes = negative skew

🔎 In Finance:
Most investors dislike negative skew (big surprise losses)

So we pay attention to this when comparing investments

✅ 2. Kurtosis – How "Fat" Are the Tails?
📌 What is it?
Kurtosis tells us whether data has more or fewer extreme values than normal.

Type of Kurtosis	Shape	What It Means
Mesokurtic (Normal)	Bell-shaped	Typical ups and downs
Leptokurtic	Fat tails	More extreme ups/downs (risky)
Platykurtic	Thin tails	Fewer extreme outcomes (less risky)

🧾 Example:

Bitcoin returns = leptokurtic

Bank savings returns = platykurtic

📌 Why It Matters:
Higher kurtosis = higher risk of extreme outcomes

Used in risk management to prepare for market crashes or spikes

✅ 3. Correlation – How Do Two Investments Move Together?
📌 What is it?
Correlation tells you if two things move in the same direction.

It ranges from −1 to +1

Correlation (r)	What It Means
+1	Perfect positive movement (same direction)
0	No relationship
−1	Perfect negative movement (opposite direction)

🧾 Example:
Stock A & Stock B have correlation = +0.9
→ When A goes up, B usually goes up

Gold & Stock Market = correlation around −0.3
→ When stocks fall, gold may rise a little

📈 Diversification Tip:
If you combine investments with low or negative correlation, your overall risk goes down.
This is a key idea in building smart portfolios.
